      Naming things is hard. Picking the right name involves a
      lot of variables. Does it sound good? Do people instantly
      relate to it? Does it
      %strong LOOK
      good?
    %p
      Moniker helps with the last of those. Send this tool to your
      clients to help with their app naming. Saves some back and forth
      time and makes sure the name that is choosen looks just as great
      underneath the app as it does within it.

      with love,
